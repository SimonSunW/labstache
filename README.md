## What is Mustache-LV?

Mustache-LV is a pure LabVIEW&trade; library for working with logic-free [mustache](https://mustache.github.io/) templates. Logic-less Mustache templates are a simple template design that works great with any text-based file, especially formats that use a markup language, i.e. HTML. This library enables [LabVIEW](https://www.ni.com/labview) developers to interact with and use Mustache templates.

## Installation

A VI Package (VIP) is available on the [National Instruments (NI)](http://www.ni.com) [LabVIEW Tools Network](http://www.ni.com/labview-tools-network/). It is recommended to use the [VI Package Manager](https://vipm.jki.net/) published by [JKI](http://jki.net/) to install and update the library.

## Documentation

See the in-app LabVIEW Help system for more information and documentation about using the library after it has been installed, or visit the [web-based documentation](https://help.fieldrndservices.com/mustache-lv). Examples are also available within the LabVIEW development environment using the `Help->Find Examples...` menu item.
